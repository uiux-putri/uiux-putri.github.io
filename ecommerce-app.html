			<h3>1 – Project Overview</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				This is my UI/UX design project during UX Design Class in Purwadhika
				Startup School. The UX case study was done for my Post Test on Module 1
				lectured by Herru Adi Vian. The brief of the case study is about how to
				create an application that help craftsman selling their product. User
				(the craftsman) can register their products and make buying and selling
				transaction easily. Here’s a little background about the situation: In
				the midst of uncertainty like this, many souvenir sellers/craftsman in
				tourism locations have been affected by the pandemic. Their merchandise
				is not selling well and their business are threatened with bankruptcy.
				This case study was solved individually. The concept is mainly intended
				to identify existing problems and to suggest potential solutions or
				alternative approaches. I use Design Thinking method to help me guide
				understanding user’s need, define the problem, and deliver the right
				solution that works. Design Thinking Step by Step: Empathize – Define –
				Ideation – Prototype
			</p>

			<br />
			<h3>2 – Empathize: Understand the user</h3>
			<p>
				The craftsmen whose businesses suffer losses due to the drastically
				reduced number of visitors.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>Here’s my findings based from the brief given:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When the pandemic will end is uncertain</li>
				<li>The enactment of the psbb disrupts store operating hours</li>
				<li>
					The number of visits by local and foreign tourists decreased
					drastically resulting in reduced income
				</li>
				<li>The threat of business bankcruptcy</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>3 – Define: What to solve and who are the users?</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				As a part of the design thinking process, I defined the users, needs,
				and insight.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, I need to define the user I’m targeting. Here are my findings
				based from the brief given:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The craftsman business is in danger of going bankrupt</li>
				<li>
					Store operating hours are disrupted due to the implementation of PSBB
				</li>
				<li>
					The number of shopgoers has drastically reduced as tourists are
					temporariy banned from entering tourist spots
				</li>
				<li>
					Business are threatened with making no profits during the pandemic
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What the user needs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A platform to display and sell products without having to meet with
					customers directly
				</li>
				<li>
					A platform where user’s customers can browser the product from
					everywhere in Indonesia without require them to travel
				</li>
				<li>A platform to do transaction and grow their sales</li>
				<li>A platform where user and their customer are connected easily</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<!-- <p>We then continue with a <b>cognitive walkthrough</b> to further evaluate the ease with which users 
            could perform a task. Apart from the same insights we have discovered from before, these are the 
            findings we found: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Confusing filter feature in "Modul Anda" page.</li>
                <li>Odd placement of "Selesai dan lanjutkan" button when going through modules.</li>
            </ul><br><br> -->
			<h3>3 – User Personal</h3>

			<br />
			<br />
			<p style="font-weight: bold; color: black">How might we :</p>
			<p>
				Based on the user, his need, and my insight below are the How Might We:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How might we help the craftsman to sell their product?</li>
				<li>
					How might we help small-to-medium business survive during the
					pandemic?
				</li>
			</ul>
